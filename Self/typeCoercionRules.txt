Q4 (Type Coercion)
Rules of Type Coercion:

1. String Concatenation:

When one operand is a string, the other is converted to a string.
Example: 2 + "2" → "22" (number 2 is converted to a string).

2.Subtraction (-) and Multiplication (*):

Non-string operands are converted to numbers.
Example: "2" - "1" → 1.


3. Boolean Coercion:

Non-boolean values are converted to booleans in logical contexts.
Example: !!"hello" → true.


4. Equality (==):

If operands are of different types, they are coerced to the same type.
Example: 2 == "2" → true.
